## SAML Metadata Validator

SAML-Schematron provides XSD validation for SAML Metadata. In addtion is the original schema 
OASIS SSTC XML Schema specification, Schematron rules perform further tests generating error and 
warning messages. Each single rule is quite trivial, typically requiring elements that are optional 
in the schema, or warning about deprecated or unwanted elements.
Validate can be defined against specific profiles. Users may want to define their own 
profile-specific rule set reusing existing rules.
