## lib

### lib/base.xsl

Extension of iso_schematron_skeleton_for_xslt1.xsl. Note that the extensions will definitely require
an xslt processor with support for exsl:node-set, although this is pretty universal for xslt 1.0 processors.

### lib/svrl.xsl

Outputs SVRL (schematron validation report language) report of validation results - a renderer for
the report format can be found at http://code.google.com/p/schematron/source/browse/trunk/converters/code/FromSVRL/SVRLReportRender.xsl?r=9eb8e4e286619a1dfb9c21a7e1010f07a5e73975
svrl.xsl can be used from the command line to output a validating stylesheet in the same way as
the other xslt implementations of schematron, so the step would be to
1. run svrl.xsl as the xslt against a schematron schema and output a validating xslt.
   java -jar xalan.jar -OUT validate/svrlval.xsl -IN profiles/allrules.sch -XSL lib/svrl.xsl
2. after which you would run svrlval.xsl against a saml file to output the schematron validation rules language report.
   java -jar xalan.jar -OUT reports/svrl2014_03_27_299949.xml -IN samldocument.saml -XSL validate/svrlval.xsl

### lib/message.xsl

Modified version of iso_schematron_message.xsl, outputting messages and xpath for the elements in the
instance document causing the message.

### lib/xalan, lib/xmlsectool
